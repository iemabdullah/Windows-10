### 1️⃣ Create GitHub Repository
- Go to GitHub and click **New Repository**.

### 🔐 2️⃣ Encode Your Link
- Go to **RDPCammand**: 🔗 [CMDRDP](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iemabdullah/Windows-10/refs/heads/main/CMD.txt)  
- Copy the RDP command or setup link you want to use.  
- Encode it using this Base64 encoder: 🔗 [https://base64.abdullah.nyc.mn/](https://base64.abdullah.nyc.mn/)  

> 💡 Tip: Keep the original command safe until you have the encoded output saved in your workflow or secrets.

---

### 3️⃣ Open Codespace or Repository Editor
- Open your GitHub Codespace (or use the online repo editor).  
- Create folders like `backend/` and add workflow or script files there.

- Paste the given encoded value and click **Decode** to get the plaintext used in the workflow.

---

### 6️⃣ Create the RDP Workflow
- Use the Base64-decoded value to generate your RDP workflow file.  
- Save the workflow file under `.github/workflows/rdp.yml`.  
- Commit and push it.

---

### 7️⃣ Run the Workflow
